              <h1>Profile</h1>
          <p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was one of the most influential and iconic musicians of the Classical Era. Born on January 27, 1756 in Salzburg, Austria, he was the youngest child of Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart. Leopold was the sole instructor of W.A. Mozart and his elder sister, Nannerl, and taught them music, academics, and languages. Mozart married Constanze Weber on August 4, 1782. The couple had six children, four of them dying during infancy. Throughout his career, Mozart experienced financial instability, caused by fluctuation in income, difficulties securing a court appointment and interludes of extravagant spending. Mozart fell ill in September, 1791 and died on December 5, 1791. There has been a great of amount of speculation concerning the circumstances of Mozart’s death. However, no conclusive evidence has uncovered the nature of the fatal illness.</p>

          <h1>Performer</h1>
          <p>Mozart was a child prodigy and started performing publicly at the age of six. He had an extraordinary memory and could play an entire piece of music after only hearing it once. He could also play musical pieces backwards. Mozart’s father, Leopold, took his son and Mozart’s elder sister to perform at various courts throughout Europe. The young virtuoso would delight his aristocratic audiences by playing the clavier and violin, as well as improvising with his sister on the keyboard. At age 13, Mozart continued to perform publicly, but no longer with his sister who was now of marriageable age. Mozart performed publicly as an instrumentalist and conductor throughout much of his adult life. He is noted for being an early exponent of the eigtheenth-century fortepiano.</p>

          <h1>Composer</h1>
          <p>Mozart began composing at the age of 5 and wrote over 600 works of music by the end of his life, 30 years later. During the early years, his father assisted with notation and made corrections. Mozart wrote religious works, symphonies, dance music,chamber music, concerti, operatic works, and choral music.  After dismissal from the Archiepiscopal court in Salzburg in 1781, Mozart became one of the first musicians in history to become a freelance musician without the backing of the court, church, or a patron. Listen to the first movement of Symphony No.40 in G minor, K.550. Also known as the "Great G minor Symphony, it is one of the last sypmphonies written by Mozart.</p><audio controls><source src="mp3/symphony40.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio>
